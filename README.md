## 🔄 Key Pipelines

### 🔹 Data Ingestion
- Supports batch ingestion from S3/GCS or streaming from Kafka.
- Cleanses, validates (using Great Expectations), and stores in feature store.

### 🔹 Feature Engineering
- Historical features materialized via Feast or custom pipeline.
- Real-time features served at prediction time.

### 🔹 Model Training
- Triggered via Airflow.
- Supports HPO (Optuna/Hyperopt) and logging to MLflow.
- Trained models are versioned and pushed to the registry.

### 🔹 Model Validation
- Offline: performance metrics, bias/fairness checks.
- Online: shadow testing or canary deployments.

### 🔹 Model Serving
- FastAPI endpoint or TorchServe model archive.
- Auto-rollbacks based on health metrics or performance degradation.

### 🔹 Monitoring
- Latency, throughput (Prometheus)
- Model drift (EvidentlyAI or custom)
- Alerts via Grafana or PagerDuty

## 🚀 Quickstart (Local)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourname/ml-system.git && cd ml-system

# Start MLflow and Feature Store locally
docker-compose up -d

# Run training job
python model_training/train.py --config configs/default.yaml

# Launch API
uvicorn model_serving.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

---

## 🧪 CI/CD

- GitHub Actions triggers:
  - Lint, test, and build Docker image
  - Push to DockerHub / Artifact Registry
  - Deploy via Helm chart to GKE / EKS
- Branch protection & PR templates for quality gating

---

## 🧭 Deployment

- Helm chart included in `infra/`
- Example config:
```bash
helm upgrade --install ml-system ./infra/helm \
  --set image.tag=latest \
  --set service.type=LoadBalancer
```

---

## 📊 Grafana Dashboard

- 📈 Latency, throughput, error rate
- 📉 Model drift, feature drift, prediction distribution
- 🧠 Model versions and deployment history

---

## 🎯 Future Work

- Real-time AB Testing framework
- Explainability with SHAP / LIME integration
- SLA-based auto-scaling on K8s
- Multi-model ensembling and routing

Want me to generate the actual code structure with working FastAPI, MLflow integration, and Airflow DAGs for this system? I can scaffold the whole project or even turn it into a cookiecutter template.
